## [Unreleased]

### Added
- CHANGELOG.md file to track project changes
- Multiselect functionality for Region, Province, and Municipality dropdowns:
  - **Region multiselect**: Users can now select multiple regions simultaneously via checkboxes. Selection state stored in `regionSelectionState.selected` (Set). Button displays "Select Region", single region name, or count of selections (e.g., "3 regions selected"). Selecting/deselecting regions automatically filters the Province dropdown. All selection changes logged to console for debugging.
  - **Province multiselect**: Users can select multiple provinces based on selected regions. Hierarchical filtering ensures only provinces within selected regions are shown. Selection state stored in `provinceSelectionState.selected` (Set). Automatically filters Municipality dropdown when provinces are selected/deselected.
  - **Municipality multiselect**: Users can select multiple municipalities based on selected regions and provinces. Hierarchical filtering ensures only municipalities within selected regions and provinces are shown. Selection state stored in `municipalitySelectionState.selected` (Set). Automatically filters Barangay dropdown when municipalities are selected/deselected.
  - **Implementation details**: All multiselect dropdowns use checkbox-based UI with opening/closing animations. Each multiselect has comprehensive initialization, rendering, toggle, and selection change handler functions. Functions include detailed documentation explaining workflow, connections, and how each multiselect works. Selection pruning automatically removes selections that are no longer available when parent selections change.
  - **Workflow**: 1) Initialize multiselect components on page load, 2) Populate options from GeoJSON data, 3) Render checkboxes for available options, 4) Handle checkbox toggles, 5) Coordinate cascading updates to lower-level dropdowns, 6) Update map highlights and zoom based on selections.
- Population analysis functionality for Numberofpeopleat24meters_12.js dataset
- Displacement calculation methodology based on hazard class percentages:
  - High hazard: 5% displacement rate
  - Medium hazard: 3% displacement rate
  - Low hazard: 1% displacement rate
- Data analysis scripts for population and displacement calculations
- Population statistics tracking:
  - Total population: 9,576 across 5,397 features
  - Affected population: 1,290 features marked as "affected": "True"
  - Displacement calculations by hazard class:
    - High hazard: 527 population → 26.35 displaced (5%)
    - Medium hazard: 412 population → 12.36 displaced (3%)
    - Low hazard: 519 population → 5.19 displaced (1%)
    - Total calculated displaced: 43.9 people
- Row numbering column ("No.") in flood exposure table for easier reference
- Charts panel on right side of map (appears automatically when flood extent is selected):
  - Pie chart showing total exposed population by hazard level (High, Medium, Low, Very Low) - shows totals when no filters selected, filtered data when barangay or exposure level is selected
  - Bar chart showing exposed population by age group (Infant, Child, Youth, Adult, Elderly, Disabled) - shows totals when no filters selected, filtered data when filters are applied
  - Charts automatically update when barangay or exposure level selection changes
  - Charts panel positioned on right side of map (no separate pane structure)

### Changed
- Enhanced data analysis capabilities for hazard assessment
- Moved "Flood Exposure" filter from table filters area to left sidebar in Flood Extent section for better organization and accessibility
- Improved layout and organization of Flood Extent controls in sidebar
- **Converted Region, Province, and Municipality dropdowns from single-select to multiselect**: All three dropdowns now use checkbox-based multiselect interface matching the existing Barangay multiselect pattern. Hierarchical filtering maintained: regions filter provinces, provinces filter municipalities, municipalities filter barangays. Updated `populateDropdowns()`, `updateProvinceDropdown()`, `updateMunicipalityDropdown()`, `updateBarangayDropdown()`, and `setupDropdownEventListeners()` to work with multiselect functionality.

### Deprecated

### Removed
- Removed "Flood Exposure" filter from table filters area (moved to sidebar)

### Fixed
- Fixed flood exposure table to show all records when filtering by Barangay and Flood Exposure dropdowns
- Removed deduplication logic that was preventing all matching records from being displayed
- Updated table counter to accurately reflect the total number of displayed records matching the selected filters
- Fixed white pane appearing on the right side by changing body/html background to dark theme and ensuring charts panel is properly hidden by default
- Fixed table overlapping with charts panel by adding proper width constraints and overflow handling to table container elements
- Adjusted table columns with fixed layout and centered headers for better fit
- Removed horizontal scrolling from table by using fixed column widths and text overflow handling
- Fixed table scrolling issue - table now scrolls vertically properly without being hidden behind charts panel by adjusting z-index and adding proper overflow handling
- Redesigned charts panel and table layout for modern, non-overlapping design:
  - Charts panel now matches table height (40vh) and aligns side-by-side
  - Added gradient backgrounds and modern styling with rounded corners
  - Enhanced visual hierarchy with improved shadows, borders, and typography
  - Chart containers have rounded corners and subtle backgrounds
  - Headers styled with uppercase text and accent borders
  - Perfect alignment with no overlapping between table and charts
- Fixed z-index and overflow issues:
  - Added proper z-index values to select elements to prevent dropdowns from floating over charts panel
  - Select dropdowns now have z-index: 1 (normal) and z-index: 100 (when focused) to ensure proper layering
  - Charts panel maintains z-index: 999, table maintains z-index: 1001
  - Sidebar has z-index: 100 to ensure proper stacking order
  - Added overflow handling to prevent content from extending beyond boundaries
- Added responsive design for multiple screen sizes:
  - Desktop (1400px+): Full width charts panel (400px)
  - Large tablets (1200px-1400px): Reduced charts panel (350px), adjusted table height (35vh)
  - Medium tablets (1024px-1200px): Further reduced charts panel (300px), smaller fonts
  - Small tablets (768px-1024px): Charts panel (280px), table height (30vh), adjusted padding
  - Mobile landscape (640px-768px): Narrower sidebar (280px), charts panel (250px), vertical filter layout
  - Mobile portrait (<640px): Charts panel moves to bottom (40vh), full width, sidebar narrows to 260px
- Fixed chart containment in right pane:
  - Added proper overflow handling to charts panel and all chart containers
  - Charts (pie and bar) now properly contained within the right pane boundaries
  - Added max-width and box-sizing constraints to prevent charts from overflowing
  - Canvas elements now respect container boundaries with proper width/height constraints
  - Chart container heights adjusted responsively for different screen sizes (280px default, 200px at 1024px, 160px at 768px, 140px at 640px)
  - Headers and chart containers now have proper text overflow handling
- Updated charts panel layout:
  - Removed height restrictions on pie and bar charts - charts now flex to fill the entire height of the right pane
  - Removed scroll from charts panel - charts spread to use all available vertical space
  - Charts use flexbox layout to evenly distribute height between pie and bar charts
  - Charts panel now extends to full viewport height (calc(100vh - 72px)) instead of 40vh, allowing charts to fill all available vertical space
  - Moved "Flood Exposure" filter back to the flood exposure table filters area (removed from sidebar)
- Fixed z-index layering for population exposure table:
  - Lowered table z-index from 1001 to 950 so modals (z-index: 1000) can appear above it
  - Table still appears above charts panel (z-index: 999) but below modals to ensure household details modal is visible
- Fixed population exposure table data to match household details:
  - Added `calculateDemographicsFromHouseholds()` function to calculate demographic counts from household data
  - Population exposure table now calculates infant, child, youth, adult, elderly, male, female, and disabled counts from household members' AGE and SEX columns
  - Counts are aggregated by exposure_id (FAMILY-ID) to match what's shown in household details modal
  - Age groups: Infant (0-4), Child (5-14), Youth (15-24), Adult (25-64), Elderly (65+)
  - Falls back to exposure dataset values if household data is not available
- Fixed charts to reflect Population exposure table data:
  - Pie chart (Hazard Level Distribution) now counts the number of rows by hazard level (High, Medium, Low, Very Low) instead of summing population
  - Bar chart (Exposed Population by Age) now uses calculated demographics from household data (same as table) - sums infant, child, youth, adult, elderly, and disabled counts
  - Charts use the same filtering logic as the table and calculate demographics the same way
  - Tooltips updated to show whole numbers (records for pie chart, population counts for bar chart)
- Added data labels to pie and bar charts:
  - Pie chart shows count values on each segment
  - Bar chart shows population values on top of each bar
  - Disabled tooltip popups on hover (tooltips.enabled: false)
  - Added chartjs-plugin-datalabels plugin for data label functionality
  - Labels use white color with bold font for better visibility
  - Set bar chart y-axis maximum to 20,000 for consistent scaling
- Removed "Ask TOMAS" button and chat widget from the interface
- Made map legend background 80% transparent (20% opacity) and changed text color to dark (#1a1a1a) for visibility on white map background
- Adjusted legend width and height to fit content (changed from fixed min-width to auto/fit-content)
- Removed location information popup (Region, Province, Municipality, Barangay) that appeared when hovering over map features
- Added automatic highlighting of all polygons displayed in the population exposure table on the map
- Enforced hierarchical dropdown selection: Province dropdown only shows options when a Region is selected, Municipality only when Province is selected, and Barangay only when Municipality is selected
- Removed barangay polygon callout overlay from the map interface
- Population exposure table now uses the barangay selected in the top pane (display only, no table-level filter)
- Removed flood exposure level filter from the population exposure table controls
- Demographics bar chart is now interactive: clicking a bar filters the population exposure table to rows with non-zero counts for that demographic; clicking empty space clears the filter
- Bar chart data labels now show formatted counts (with thousands separators) directly above each bar
- Flood extent dropdown is disabled until a barangay is selected; clearing barangay reset hides flood layers automatically
- Selecting a row in the population exposure table no longer opens the household modal automatically
- Household navigation button once again only toggles the household polygon layer visibility
- Added filtered household overlay and barangay highlight: the households button now displays only polygons inside the chosen barangay and the selected barangay is outlined on the map
- Selecting a grid row zooms the map to its polygon; clicking the polygon on the map opens the household details modal and keeps the row selection in sync
- Created `countHouseholdsByBarangay()` function to count households by barangay, with optional municipality filtering
- Household button now toggles the `People_0` layer while keeping household polygons hidden for clearer demographic review
- Implemented FAMILY-ID based lookup that returns all matching household rows when a `People_0` polygon is clicked, and logs the full result set
- Expanded `findHouseholdDataByFamilyId()` and related helpers to handle both `FAMILY-ID` and `FAMILY_ID` fields for consistent cross-layer matching
- Barangay selector upgraded to a multi-checkbox control: zoom, highlight, filtered household overlays, population table, and charts all respond to every checked barangay; selections stay highlighted until an empty map click clears them, with detailed console logging for each update
- Infographics and Impact Report actions now remain disabled until at least one barangay is selected, preventing accidental usage without context while preserving their original functionality once enabled
- Household button once again drives the `Households_1` dataset directly: clicking it shows all household polygons, or only those whose `BARANGAY` matches the current selection (with detailed logs); the `People_0` layer is suppressed whenever barangays are chosen to keep the view focused on households
